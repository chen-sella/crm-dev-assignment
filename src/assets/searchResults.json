For this I got the opportunity to work on Adobeâs consumer video editing tool; Premiere Elements 11. This was a very big task, and the challenge was to completely Re-imagine the tool for a much towards consumer oriented design, as before it closely mimicked it's professional sibling the Premiere Pro with ideals of a more user friendly UI. I have worked closely with Sharad Baliyan the UX designer to get closer to this goal. The output was quite well received by consumers in several rounds of User research and in Adobeâs pre-release program. It is deemed for release on later half of this year.Â  Adding more to my work I got an opportunity to work on Icon design for Adobeâs e-Learning tool Captivate and Presenter. The challenge was stiff and I learned a lot from this work plus I got a chance to work with Adobeâs Icon team based in Hamburg. This experience has added a new skill set to my arsenal of professional experience in visual design, my work has been lauded by consumers of the software.",

The study was conducted in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia with an objective to gauge the existing communication model which on optimization may lead to betterment of lives especially for those employed in the sub-urban areas. Telephone use was perceived to provide a much higher benefit in providing a sense of security in terms of acting in an emergency and in maintaining social relationships than benefiting financially though the potential for greater income earning ability and saving costs at the BOP and this seems to be continuing trend even in 2011. The studies have consistently shown the phone being used primarily for social purposes, with more âutilitarianâ uses (such as use for business, financial or work-related) being secondary. The most recent findings show however that there is a segment of the BOP which uses the phone for utilitarian purposes on a daily basis.",
